# chickhunt

In Chick'Hunt, as the name says, you're going to hunt... chickens ??
With your bow and arrows, you'll have to hit all chickens that are invading your village during the given time.
The faster you take them down, the more points you'll earn.
Arrows and power ups are scattered throughout the village to help you against the invader.

This is my first "complete" game for Android, and I'm proud to share it to everyone.
There are still bugs and small issues, so don't worry if something weird happens (getting stuck inside a house or behind the barriers for example).
